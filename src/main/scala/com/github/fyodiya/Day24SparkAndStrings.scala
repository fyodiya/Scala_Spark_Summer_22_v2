  //String manipulation shows up in nearly every data flow, and it’s worth explaining what you can
  //do with strings. You might be manipulating log files performing regular expression extraction or
  //substitution, or checking for simple string existence, or making all strings uppercase or
  //lowercase.
  //Let’s begin with the last task because it’s the most straightforward. The initcap function will
  //capitalize every word in a given string when that word is separated from another by a space.

  //putting everything in upper case
  df.select(col("Description"),
    initcap(col("Description")))
    .show(3, truncate = false)

  //all SQL functions are listed here; https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html
  spark.sql("SELECT Description, initcap(Description) FROM dfTable")
    .show(3, truncate = false) //false shows full strings in columns, without truncation/cutting

  //As just mentioned, you can cast strings in uppercase and lowercase, as well:

  df.select(col("Description"),
    lower(col("Description")),
    upper(lower(col("Description")))) //the lower here is not necessary, it's an example shows nesting
    .show(3, truncate = false)

  spark.sql("SELECT Description, lower(Description), " +
    "upper(lower(Description)) FROM dfTable") //again upper(lower is not needed but it might be useful for some other function
    .show(3, truncate = false)

  //Another trivial task is adding or removing spaces around a string. You can do this by using lpad,
  //ltrim, rpad and rtrim, trim:

  //one real or original column
  //other columns are made-up by us
  df.select(
    col("CustomerId"), //not needed, here it is used just to show you how we work with the dateframe
    ltrim(lit(" HELLO ")).as("ltrim"),
    rtrim(lit(" HELLO ")).as("rtrim"),
    functions.trim(lit(" HELLO ")).as("trim"),
    lpad(lit("HELLO"), 3, " ").as("lp"),
    rpad(lit("HELLO"), 10, " ").as("rp"),
    //😁 is represented by 4 bytes that's why you have \u twice
    lpad(rpad(lit("HELLO"), 10, "*"), 15, "\uD83D\uDE01").as("pad15charstotal")
  ).show(2)
  //so pad even works with high value unicode after 128k which is smileys

  //so lpad (rpad is similar)
  //Left-pad the string column with pad to a length of len.
  //If the string column is longer than len, the return value is shortened to len characters.

  //Regular Expressions
  //Probably one of the most frequently performed tasks is searching for the existence of one string
  //in another or replacing all mentions of a string with another value. This is often done with a tool
  //called regular expressions that exists in many programming languages. Regular expressions give
  //the user an ability to specify a set of rules to use to either extract values from a string or replace
  //them with some other values.
  //Spark takes advantage of the complete power of Java regular expressions. The Java regular
  //expression syntax departs slightly from other programming languages, so it is worth reviewing
  //before putting anything into production. There are two key functions in Spark that you’ll need in
  //order to perform regular expression tasks: regexp_extract and regexp_replace. These
  //functions extract values and replace values, respectively.
  //Let’s explore how to use the regexp_replace function to replace substitute color names in our
  //description column:

  //prepping regex in Scala - could do it by hand of course by writing up full regex
  val simpleColors = Seq("black", "white", "red", "green", "blue")
  val regexString = simpleColors.map(_.toUpperCase).mkString("|")
  println(regexString) //"BLACK|WHITE|RED|GREEN|BLUE"

  df.select(
    regexp_replace(col("Description"), regexString, "COLOR").alias("color_clean"),
    col("Description"))

  spark.sql(

      |SELECT
      |regexp_replace(Description, 'BLACK|WHITE|RED|GREEN|BLUE', 'colorful') as

      |FROM dfTable
      |""".stripMargin)

  //ideally there would be even number of _______LATVIA__________ (30 total)
  //select Description column again with all occurrences of metal or wood replaced with material
  //so this description white metal lantern -> white material lantern
